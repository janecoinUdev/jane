===================


A record 
----------


A record of the shenanigans of [Jane](https://github.com/janecoindev/jane/), or [XonX](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1697694.0) (or whatever).

Jane trades at [Cryptopia](https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange/?market=JANE_BTC) and [Yobit](https://yobit.net/en/trade/JANE/BTC). 

Jane does not have a blockexplorer or even a website, but was added to Cryptopia within days where you can pay for listings, and soon after to Yobit.

Jane has funny habits, and will try to manipulate the blockchain (partly by not publishing one).
